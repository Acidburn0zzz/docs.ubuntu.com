Version
=======

MAAS publishes a special view at ``.../api/1.0/version/`` that returns the
version of the MAAS server and the list of the server's capabilities.
When programmatically probing a MAAS installation, use only the
``capabilities`` list. Avoid using ``version`` and ``subversion`` for anything
other than informational purposes. It's transferred as a JSON document::

    {
      "subversion": "bzr4001",
      "version": "1.8.0",
      "capabilities": [
          "name-of-capability-1",
          "name-of-capability-2"
      ]
    }


List of capabilities
--------------------

Check for the following strings in the capabilities list to see what
features the MAAS server supports. Use these in preference to gating on
the version when creating a client application.
